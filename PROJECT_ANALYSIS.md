## Bottlenecks & Challenges

### 🔴 Critical Issues

**1. Main Branch Empty State**
- **Problem:** The latest commit on main (71309fa) reverted PR #50, leaving the main branch in an empty state
- **Impact:** No files in working tree, deployment likely broken
- **Root Cause:** The revert commit appears to have removed all files instead of just reverting the Radix Themes changes
- **Status:** **BLOCKING** - Needs immediate attention
- **Recommendation:** Restore files from commit 5d1a92c or rebuild main branch

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

**2. Testing Coverage Gaps**
- **Issue:** Only 27 test files for 65+ components and 50+ pages
- **Coverage:** Approximately 35-40% of components have tests
- **Impact:** Reduced confidence in component stability
- **Recommendation:** Add tests for remaining components

**3. E2E Test Scope**
- **Issue:** Limited E2E test coverage visible
- **Impact:** User flows not fully validated
- **Recommendation:** Expand Playwright tests for critical paths

**4. Documentation Completeness**
- **Issue:** While component pages exist, some may lack comprehensive examples
- **Impact:** Learning curve for component usage
- **Recommendation:** Audit and enhance component documentation

### 🟢 Minor Observations

**5. Dependency Management**
- **Observation:** Using latest versions of most packages (good!)
- **Consideration:** React 19 is cutting edge - may have compatibility issues
- **Recommendation:** Monitor for breaking changes

**6. Build Performance**
- **Current:** No build time metrics visible
- **Recommendation:** Add build performance monitoring
